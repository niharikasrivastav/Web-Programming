How to Screen Prospective Buyers
Once the word is out that you have puppies for sale, all kinds of people will come calling. The challenge as a responsible breeder is to weed out the unsuitable candidates and find people that have the time, means and desire to give one of your pups a happy, lifelong home.

A prospective buyer should:

<ul> <li>Have enough time to spend with a puppy and train it </li>
<li>Provide truly adequate shelter from the elements </li>
<li>Have a fenced in yard so the puppy can exercise safely </li>
<li>Have permission from his or her landlord to house a pet if only renting the dwelling </li>
<li>Realize that dogs require routine veterinary care, including vaccinations and annual check ups </li>
<li>Be able to afford to pay for that veterinary care </li>
<li>Be willing to provide high quality food and fresh water at all times </li>
<li>Understand the grooming needs of the particular breed </li>
</ul>
