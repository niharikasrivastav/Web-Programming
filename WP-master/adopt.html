Tips for the First Week With Your Newly Adopted Dog - Just like us, dogs need order and leadership. They seek order, which you must provide. Your dog needs to know that you are the in charge and that you have a set of rules to live by. This makes the transition from the shelter to your home easier, faster and more rewarding. 
<br/>
The Myths of Dog Adoption - Did you know that most dogs do not have a home due to no fault of their own? Dog shelters and rescues are full of lovable, active and healthy adoptable dogs just waiting for someone to take them home. A majority of dogs are given up when their prior owner can no longer afford the financial requirements to keep them, got divorced, had a death in the family or other unexpected change in their family situation, or didn't realize how much time & attention a dog adoption deserves and needs.
<br/>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some Rescue Dogs Are Already Trained for a Home - Even though living in a dog rescue isn't ideal, most rescues (and some shelters) are assisting the dogs in more ways than just keeping it alive. Dogs can be socialized with other animals that help make them kinder and playful with all types of animals. 
<br/>
Rescues Are Pros at Matching You With the Right Dog Adoption - Shelter workers are very careful to make sure their dog adoptions go well and their dogs end up in the best homes for dog and owner. Each organization has its own dog adoption application and screening process for potential adopters. 
<br/>
FAQ for Dog Veterinarian Visits - Taking your newly adopted dog to the veterinarian should be your first priority. This is especially true if you have other pets. It's a good idea to make sure your new dog is healthy and doesn't have any diseases or viruses he or she could transmit to other animals in the house. <br/>
